# Competitive Programming Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various programming problems from three popular competitive programming platforms: LeetCode, Codeforces, and GeeksforGeeks. The purpose of this repository is to share my solutions and showcase my problem-solving skills in the field of competitive programming.

## Table of Contents

- [LeetCode](#leetcode)
- [Codeforces](#codeforces)
- [GeeksforGeeks](#geeksforgeeks)

## LeetCode

The LeetCode directory contains my solutions to problems available on the LeetCode platform. Each problem has its own directory named after the problem's unique identifier. Inside each directory, you will find the solution file along with a README file explaining the problem and my approach to solving it.

## Codeforces

The Codeforces directory contains my solutions to problems from the Codeforces platform. Similar to the LeetCode section, each problem has its own directory named after the problem's unique identifier. Inside each directory, you will find the solution file and a README file with a problem description and my approach to solving it.

## GeeksforGeeks

The GeeksforGeeks directory contains my solutions to problems from the GeeksforGeeks platform. Similarly, each problem has its own directory named after the problem's unique identifier. Inside each directory, you will find the solution file and a README file with a problem description and my approach to solving it.

## Contributing

If you find any bugs in the solutions or have alternative approaches to the problems, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Your contributions are highly appreciated!
